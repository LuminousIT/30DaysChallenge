### 30 Days.
Learning in public by exposing one self to the uncomfortable eyes of many onlookers, especially on linkedin, is a double edged sword. You either succeed or fail spetacularly. More importantly, it is an opportunity to hold oneself accountable to the decisions made. 

A quick backstory...
2023 was a good year for many reasons, I moved to a new country, started my masters program, got a decent student job as a Frontend Engineer in a research institute, completed two AWS certifications (Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate), went on vacation and so on. In short, it was nothing short of amazing and I hoped to do same in 2024 but I have been slow to catch on, especially with Personal Development. 

I'm making progress at University and workplace, but I'd like to do more in scaling up my technical skills. Hence, I'm starting a 30 days challenge to get the ball rolling!

> Start Date: **26/05/2024**
> Evaluation Date: **26/06/2024**

Like the saying goes:
> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the next best time is today.


**I would be updating daily progress on Github primarily and try to keep up with an update here on LinkedIn at least once or twice a week.**

**Technical Background**
- 4 years experience with Javascript technologies - React, React Native, NodeJS/Express, MongoDB.
- Understands C# enough to implement small features within a big project using C#


#### 3 things I hope to improve upon:
1. Health / Fitness - Home Workout everyday or Gym 2-3x/week
2. Technical Skills - Learn a new language - Python - by Practicing Data Structure and Algorithms and Building small Projects with django
3. Learn Deutsch - By writing and speaking.


### Task
For the next 30 Days;
1. Practice DSA every morning with Python
2. Go to gym (2-3x/week) or do a home workout everyday.
3. Build small projects with django...
4. Write a simple deutsch letter everyday
