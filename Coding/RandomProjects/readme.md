### Progress Monitor

- Project One: Building a production ready django project template


#### Day One
- Worked on setting up accessiweb. a web app that allows users to upload an image and uses ML to give a description of the image. It is a mini project from Fh-Dortmund
- AccessiWeb routes setup, login/dashboard protected route


**Learned something new?**
- when you don't follow shadcn install instructions strictly, expect some funny issues like css not showing. Renaming tailwind.config.js to .ts and make sure app/global.css is within src/ directory is a good debug start point. Spent an unholy amount of time fixing this seemingly simple thing.


#### Day Two
- AccessiWeb Home, History, Profile page

#### Day Three
- Started working on Accessiweb responsive navigation
- 

### Day Four
- Rewrote navigation to be responsive

### Day Five
- Setup base repo for Agroweb Django project. Backend for an ecommerce website
